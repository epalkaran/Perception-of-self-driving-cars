<h1>Introduction</h1>
Imagine getting into a car, typing—or, better yet speaking—a location into the vehicle’s interface, then letting it drive us to our destination while we read a book, surf the web, or nap. Self-driving vehicles—the stuff of science fiction since the first roads were paved—are coming, and they’re going to radically change what it’s like to get from point A to point B. The idea behind self-driving cars is fairly simple: build a car with cameras that can track all the objects around it. The car should react if it’s about to steer into one. And once in-car computers know all driving rules, they should be able to navigate to their destination.In this project we have tried to implement how the self driving cars tracks objects around it and determines the path that it should follow.
<h2>Implementation</h2>
First let’s discuss the concepts that will enable our on-board computer to track objects and roads and the function each of them perform.
